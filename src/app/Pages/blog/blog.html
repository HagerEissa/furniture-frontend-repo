      Does walking into your living room feel a little flat? You’re not alone. We all yearn for a
      home that is luxurious, sleek and inviting all at the same time, yet often we find it
      difficult to figure out how to get there. You could buy a new couch or throw pillows or spruce
      it up with some popular decorations. But how do you elevate your space into something more
      special? Not to shamelessly weaponize my day job, but it’s actually a lot simpler than you
      think.

      The best online furniture stores have a few things in common: a well-curated selection of
      items, decent enough shipping timelines to get you that sectional sofa right on schedule, and
      of course enough style to round out your home without dragging down your decor scheme. So many
      newer D2C players have entered the flat-packing arena, though, that we thought we’d pull
      together a list of the all-time greats and all of our newer faves for furniture that are here
      for a long time (not just for the duration of your current rental).

      When we think of minimalism, we often imagine simple lines and neutral hues. The AUSTER sofa
      meets these criteria perfectly. With its generous dimensions and velvet upholstery, it
      transforms your living room into a warm, modern space. Its black wood frame and discreet feet
      add a touch of elegance. Ideal for those looking for functional furniture without compromising
      on aesthetics. To liven up your living room, pair this sofa with softly-toned cushions or a
      knitted blanket for a cosy effect. It can also be paired with a minimalist coffee table or
      geometric lighting fixtures to reinforce visual harmony.
